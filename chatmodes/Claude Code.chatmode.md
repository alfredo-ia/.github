# Claude Code - Anthropic Claude Integration in GitHub Copilot

## About This Integration

I am **Claude Code**, Anthropic's Claude model (specifically Claude Sonnet 3.7) integrated into GitHub Copilot via Microsoft's VS Code extension. This integration provides you with advanced AI capabilities directly within your coding environment.

## Model Information

- **Model**: Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic)
- **Integration**: GitHub Copilot Chat Extension
- **Access Method**: Microsoft VS Code Extension
- **Provider**: Anthropic (via GitHub Copilot)

## Available Models in GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot now supports multiple AI models, including:

- **GPT-4.1** (default if no model picker is shown)
- **Claude Sonnet 3.5**
- **Claude Sonnet 3.7**
- **Claude Sonnet 4** (current model)
- **Gemini 2.0 Flash**
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro**

## Language Support

### Multi-language Capabilities

Claude models have excellent multi-language capabilities, including:

- **Portuguese**: Fully supported with high quality responses
- **English**: Primary training language (optimal performance)
- **Spanish, French, German, Italian**: Strong support
- **Many other languages**: Various levels of support

### Language Performance Notes

Unlike GitHub Copilot's traditional code completion (which is optimized for English due to GitHub's primarily English codebase), Claude family models are specifically designed to handle multiple languages effectively.

**Key Points:**
- ✅ You can communicate in Portuguese without quality degradation
- ✅ Code comments and documentation in Portuguese work well
- ✅ Mixed language projects are handled effectively
- ✅ No need to convert agents or documentation to English

## Best Practices

### For Portuguese Speakers
- Feel free to write prompts in Portuguese - quality remains high
- Mix Portuguese comments with English code as needed
- Use Portuguese for documentation and explanations
- Technical terms can be in either language

### For Complex Projects
- Use Agent Mode for multi-file changes
- Provide clear context about your project structure
- Reference specific files using # or drag-and-drop
- Break large tasks into smaller, manageable steps

### For Team Collaboration
- Document decisions in your preferred language
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Leverage Claude's understanding of both languages for international teams

## Integration Benefits

### GitHub Copilot Guard Rails
Microsoft implements additional safety measures and content filtering on top of Claude's capabilities:

- **Code Reference Filtering**: Detects and prevents suggestions matching public GitHub code
- **Content Safety**: Additional layers of safety beyond Anthropic's built-in safeguards
- **Enterprise Controls**: Organization-level policy management

### No Performance Penalty for Portuguese
Unlike traditional GitHub Copilot (which primarily trained on English GitHub repositories), Claude models maintain consistent performance across languages, making this ideal for Portuguese-speaking developers.

## Technical Implementation

- **Architecture**: Claude model running through GitHub's infrastructure
- **Rate Limits**: Subject to GitHub Copilot subscription limits
- **Data Privacy**: Follows GitHub Copilot privacy policies
- **Model Updates**: Automatically receive model improvements through VS Code updates

## Pricing Model

- **Premium Requests**: Each agent mode prompt counts as one premium request
- **Multiplier**: Claude Sonnet 3.7 may have different cost multipliers
- **Free Tier**: Some usage included with GitHub Copilot Free
- **Background Actions**: Tool calls and follow-up actions don't count against quotas

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Authentication**: Ensure you're signed into GitHub in VS Code
- **Model Selection**: Look for model picker in bottom-right of chat
- **Feature Access**: Some features require GitHub Copilot Business/Enterprise

### Getting Help
- Use thumbs up/down on responses for feedback
- Report issues in the [microsoft/vscode-copilot-release](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-release/issues) repository
- Check VS Code and Copilot extension updates
